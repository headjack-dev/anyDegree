## Usage
The latest `anyDegree.unitypackage` is available from the [releases](https://github.com/headjack-dev/anyDegree/releases) page.

You can also clone and use the `headjack-dev/anyDegree` git repository directly in a Unity project. 

Inside, you find some example scenes with example materials, and the amount of viewport degrees can be set using the `Horizontal Degrees` and `Vertical Degrees` sliders.
